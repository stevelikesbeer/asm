; Console Input Buffer 
; The Win32 console has an input buffer containing an array of input
; event records. Each input event, such as a keystroke, mouse movement, or mouse-button click,
; creates an input record in the consoleâ€™s input buffer. High-level input functions such as
; ReadConsole filter and process the input data, returning only a stream of characters

ReadConsoleA     PROTO,
                    hConsoleInput:DWORD,                ; it would normally be HANDLE instead of dword, but irvine equ's handle to dword
                    lpBuffer:PTR BYTE,                  ; pointer to the buffer
                    nNumberOfCharsToRead:DWORD,         ; number of chars to read
                    lpNumberOfCharsToRead:PTR DWORD,    ; pointer to number of bytes to read
                    lpReserved:DWORD                    ; not used
                ; hConsoleInput is a valid console input handle returned by the GetStdHandle function. 
                ; lpBuffer parameter is the offset of a character array. 
                ; nNumberOfCharsToRead is a 32-bit integer specifying the maximum number of characters to read. 
                ; lpNumberOfCharsRead is a pointer to a doubleword that permits the function to fill in, 
                ;   when it returns, a count of the number of characters placed in the buffer.
                ; The last parameter is not used, so pass the value zero

                ; When calling ReadConsoleA, include two extra bytes in your input buffer to hold the end-of-
                ; line characters. If you want the input buffer to contain a null-terminated string, replace the byte
                ; containing 0Dh with a null byte. This is exactly what is done by the ReadString procedure from
